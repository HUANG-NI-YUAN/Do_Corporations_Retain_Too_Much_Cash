# Do_Corporations_Retain_Too_Much_Cash

- Topic
  - Reproduced the work by Hwanki Brian Kim and others published in "The Review of Financial Studies," titled "Do Corporations Retain Too Much Cash? Evidence from a Natural Experiment." Following the authors' approach, conducted a study using Chinese local data and obtained similar conclusions.
 
- Attention
  -  In the process of reproducing the work, we utilized simulated data provided by the authors instead of real data. Despite communicating with the authors, they were unable to provide us with real data due to data agreements, and the option to directly purchase the real data was rendered unfeasible due to the expensive costs, which we couldn't afford. As a result, the replication section does not include data. The authors' data can be accessed online as they have been published.
